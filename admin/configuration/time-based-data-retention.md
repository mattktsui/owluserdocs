# Time Based Data Retention

## **Setting up Retention Based Data Purge**

Retention based purge of data can be turned on to allow data to automatically be cleaned based on an organization's data retention policy.

### **Benefit**

Once enabled, what type of data is removed?

* Dataset statistics
* Data\_Preview
* Dataset\_Field
* Rule\_Breaks
* Job Ledger

### **Setup**

In order to set up retention based data purge, three (3) environment variables need to be set up in the owl-env.sh configuration script.  Note:  a restart of the webapp is required for this configuration to take place.

* **cleaner\_retention\_enabled**
  * TRUE or FALSE on whether this feature is enabled
* **cleaner\_retention\_days**
  * Number of days to retain data
* **cleaner\_retention\_field**
  * Controls which field to use to select eligible dataset runs
  * Potential values
    * updt\_ts:  consider the last time a dataset run was updated
    * run\_id:  consider the run id field of the dataset

### Configuration

**Example configuration in owl-env.sh**

Organization wants to purge data where the updt\_ts is more than 1 year old

**In owl-env.sh, add the following lines**

```
export cleaner_retention_enabled=TRUE
export cleaner_retention_days=365
export cleaner_retention_field="updt_ts" 
```

### Config Map

```
autoClean: "false"
cleaner_retention_days: "180"
cleaner_retention_field: updt_ts
cleaner_retention_enabled: "true"
```
