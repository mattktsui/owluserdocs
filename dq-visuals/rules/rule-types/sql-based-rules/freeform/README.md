# Freeform

Where 'Simple' rules just use the condition, 'Freeform' rules use the complete SQL statement. When more complex SQL is required, you can express more with Freeform including joins, CTE's and window statements.

```
select * from @DATASET_NAME where 
email_address is not null and email_address != '' 
```

All built-in spark functions are available to use. ([https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/)) for simple and freeform sql rules.‌
