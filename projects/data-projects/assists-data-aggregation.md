# Assists Data Aggregation

* **Greatly reduce Support Costs.**  Apply AI-generated rules to maintain consistency across all accounts, rather than apply hand-made rules per every account.  You are not managing 100+ variations of rules, but a consistent set that is learned from all.&#x20;
* **Capitalize on Real-time.**  Batch collection with excel compare will never support real-time.  Instead, rules are generated by the data itself, and anomalies are triggered on the fly at the source system.
* **Rapid Onboarding.**  Universal and already tested Scans are applied quickly.
* **Improve Customer Satisfaction.** Monitor the real-time speed of the DQ pushdown fix, not just the overall DQ score over time.
* **Improved SLAs.**  When DQ is fixed immediately, all SLAs can be improved not just DQ SLAs. &#x20;
