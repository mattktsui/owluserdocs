# DQ Job Kafka

### Kafka Requires Zookeeper

Apache Kafka typically requires zookeeper.  This file and cmd can be run from inside /kafka/bin&#x20;

```python
# Start the ZooKeeper service
# Note: Soon, ZooKeeper will no longer be required by Apache Kafka.
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```

### Start a Kafka Server

Precursor step to Owl (you likely already have this step completed if you use Kafka)

```scala
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

### Start a Kafka Topic

Precursor step to Owl (you likely already have this step completed if you use Kafka)

```python
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test

# prefered cmd is below
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test
```

### Put a msg on "test" Topic

```scala
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test
```

### Kafka Consumer or Owl Consumer

Kafka works as a topic so you can have many consumers.  Here is a basic cmdline consumer but we can add Owl as a second consumer.

```scala
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning
```

```scala
/opt/owl/bin/owlcheck.sh       
      -kafkatopic test
      -ds machine1
      -streamformat csv 
      -kafkaport  9092 
      -kafkabroker localhost
      -streaminterval 60
      -stream -kafka 
      -header  first_name
      -master local
```

### Streams vs Sensors

Technically speaking anything moving in real-time is a stream of data but Owl classifies streams and IoT sensors as slightly different for the following reasons:

#### Sensors

Sensors are commonly a standard time-series. Signal, Time, Value

| Signal      | Time                | Value |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| device1-CPU | 2019-02-11 13:40:55 | 4     |
| device1-CPU | 2019-02-11 14:33:20 | 2     |

#### Streams

Streams commonly look like messages, jsons, avro or batch data but constantly flowing.  Another way to think of it is a multiple time-series

```
[
    trade: {
        price: 23.75,
        qty: 20,
        symbol: HDP
    },
        trade: {
    }
]
```

| fname | age | networth | email          |
| ----- | --- | -------- | -------------- |
| Joe   | 45  | $130,000 | joe@yahoo.com  |
| Mark  | 33  | $125,000 | mark@yahoo.com |

The difference between a Sensor and a Stream in the above example is that in the case of the sensor the user is primarily concerned with the actual value of the "Value".  Meaning a spike in temperature or a drop in CPUs.  But in a stream of customer data there isn't a time "X" and value "Y" there are many values "Y" and you a user is interested in the overall quality of both the entire stream and the individual values.  Relationship analysis and other correlative functions apply here.  If you were to chart a "stream" what would you chart?  The row count volume or just one of the columns or the count of something?  But if you were to chart a sensor you know exactly what you would chart... the "Value" over "Time". &#x20;

Fortunately Owl has already thought and worked through the many nuances required to understand, monitor and predict accurately for all of these use-case.  All that is required is to subscribe the stream.&#x20;
