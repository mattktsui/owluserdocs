# DQ Job Cron

### Cron / Autosys / Control M / Oozie

It is common for organization to need to run jobs on a schedule.  Below are a few shell tricks to get a date from bash and use an OwlCheck with template variables.

Kinit and get run\_date from shell or job control variable, pass it into Owl using $run\_date

```bash
%sh
run_date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
run_date=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')
echo $run_date

#kinit
echo "password" | kinit  userabc@CW.COM

~/owl/bin/owlcheck -q "select * from lake.stock_eod where date = '$run_date' " \
-u user -p pass \
-c "jdbc:mysql://owldatalake.chzid9w0hpyi.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306" \
-rd "$run_date" \
-dc "date" \
-dl \
-dllb 7 \
-dlminhist 2 \
-tbin DAY \
-dlkey sym,exch \
-ds "lake.stock_nasdaq" \
-driver "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" \
-lib "/home/ec2-user/owl/drivers/mysql/" \
-master yarn -deploymode client -numexecutors 1 -executormemory 1g \
-loglevel DEBUG
```

### Template

You can also use -template to use Owl as a service hook and remove the need to pass in almost anything.  In this case Owl will look up the template automatically from either a previous run or if you've saved a template, and use these variables.  Any variable at the cmdline will override and win/replace.  This is a great way to remove connection and other information from being hard coded into the job control framework and allows edit ability from Owl Webapp. &#x20;

```bash
%sh
~/owl/bin/owlcheck -usetemplate -ds lake.stock_nasdaq -rd $run_date
```

### Owl Scheduler - Built In

A quick option is to use Owl's built in scheduler. Owl will automatically substitute the runtime variables like ${rd} into the job.  This also gives you control to edit the OwlCheck.&#x20;

The schedule is based on the OwlCheck Template.  This way the runtime variables are replaced in each run.  Notice the ${rd} below.&#x20;

### All Scheduled Jobs in 1 Place

Under the jobs dashboard you can see an overview schedule with all running jobs and their status.
