# Schedule Management

![](../../.gitbook/assets/job\_schedule.gif)

Enable Scheduled Jobs from your environment variable in owl-env.sh

SCHEDULE\_ENABLED = TRUE/FALSE (Default = TRUE)

Limit Scheduler Open Time-slots:

If you don't want automated jobs to be running during business hours, or for a particular day/time on any given day of the week you can set "off-limit" times so authorized users don't select them when scheduling a job.
