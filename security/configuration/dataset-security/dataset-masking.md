# Dataset Masking

## Masking From the UI

After an owlcheck has been run you can perform column level masking from the hoot page if you have ROLE\_ADMIN or ROLE\_DATASET\_MANAGER.

{% hint style="info" %}
Masking updates will take effect for all existing and future runs of the selected dataset.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
ROLE\_ADMIN and ROLE\_DATASET\_MANAGER also have the ability to unmask.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
