# Adding Local Users

Users can request access to the application from the login page by clicking the register link under the login button. Application administrators can also create user accounts by navigating to the Admin Console and clicking on the Users Icon. In either case, simply fill out the account form and a user record will be created. The user account at this stage will not have access to the application until an application administrator grants that user access to an owl role or multiple roles.

### Granting Local User Roles <a href="#hgrantinglocaluserroles" id="hgrantinglocaluserroles"></a>

Application administrators can manage user accounts and role access by navigating to the Admin Console and clicking on the Users Icon. On that page locate the user you would like to modify and click on their username in the table of users. This will load a pop-up window that allows you to modify the user account including Enabled/Disabled as well as the roles they belong to. Click on the Roles tab to begin granting roles to the selected user. The available roles established will be listed on the left, click a role from the left-hand side to apply that role to the user. You can also add all roles by clicking the double arrow icon above the list. When you are satisfied with the role listings on the right-hand side for that user, click the Update button. There will be more on creating custom application roles in the RBAC Section of this document.
